On openOffice Macro's - name sheet to (1) - only between parenthesis.

macros does do music also with rearrange arrange if i shared the code unknown?

add to numbered, to two columns left, like satan bible's, add anything you like.

then, in macro, add A:B to number, then add size to other part, in macro.

in some python files, may have to rename

import Tkinter

to 

import tkinter

--Shawn

To make an animation file, sort of, with macro's number left column, all 1's, then two at end of far left column, with 1 next to 2, the rest number thru 1 - 1##########, before the 2. all ways.

also, to make random art draw a big X or diamond, have a good PEACE!
